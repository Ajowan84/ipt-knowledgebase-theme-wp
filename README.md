# iPanelThemes Knowledgebase for WordPress
Finally a free and open source knowledgebase theme made specifically for WordPress.
Uses twitter bootstrap for rendering UI components and some other open source elements
for rendering niceness.

`This is currently in development. Use it if you want, but don't yell if it breaks`

## Acknowledgement

all the tools that were used during the development of this theme.

* [*Twitter Bootstrap 3.0*](http://getbootstrap.com/): Nothing would've been possible without this.
* [*Icomoon Icons*](http://icomoon.io/): Along with Glyphicons, we've included icomoon for more icons.
* [*Sticky-kit*](https://github.com/leafo/sticky-kit): A little forked version of it to provide the affix widget.
