# Theme Customizer Modueles

We intend to use customizer for all our future themes, instead of the options panel.

To properly and smoothly import, we need to create several controls, specifically these:

1. SDA List
2. Toogle Elements
3. Icon Selector

We will add more in future

Some plugins/themes to look into:

1. [Customify](https://github.com/pixelgrade/customify)
2. [LayersWP](https://github.com/Obox/layerswp)
